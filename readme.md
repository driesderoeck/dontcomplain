# Don't complain - open sourced assets

This set of files can be used or adapted freely to create any kind of prints or digital files. When using them, I would greatly appreciate any kind of reference when people ask about them. I do not expect a reference to be printed on the artwork you create, as that would only ruin the print.

If you want to reference or credit these files, a suggested way to do so is:

"Don't complain... design by Dries De Roeck www.roeckoe.be"

The backstory to this project is captured on the crowdfunding page funded the inital printing round of this sticker: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/driesdr/dont-complain-stickers-and-artprints-make100/

## Files in this package

There are two files released as part of this package. All fonts used to create these assets are either under Creative Commons license or Open Font liscense.

dontcomplain_gold : the type and layout used to print the GOLD sticker. This file uses fontfaces League Spartan (OFL) and Courgette Regular (OFL)

dontcomplain_regular : the type and layout used to print the REGULAR stickers. This files uses fontfaces Gilbert (CC Attribution Share Alike) and Zilla slab (OFL)

All other graphics files and artworks created as part of the original crowdfunding campaign will not be made available as part of these GPL licensed files. If you want to use other graphical assets, please get in touch via www.roeckoe.be.

## License

I'm releasing these assets under GPL, mostly because I would never want anyone to use these assets to profit or run a commercial business on. The initial kickstarter campaign that started this was totally break even, all involved artists were paid for their work and all production costs were covered.
